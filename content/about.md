I develop this web to practice writing concisely and well explaining complex things (to me). Current topics mostly regard programming and economics. In the long run, I want to be better at machine learning applications in a development context and economic/quant modelling. 

For now, I only know how to write in one language. Vietnamese and French might be produced in the future haha. Please do share anything with me regarding this web! Thanks for your visit.
