I develop this web to practice writing concisely and well explaining complex things (to me). Current topics mostly regard programming and economics. In the long run, I want to be better at machine learning applications in a development context and economic/quant modelling. Some research questions...

I currently work in an non-profit organization in Vietnam, focusing on data. I graduated in May 2022 from Dickinson College - amazing times but regrettably under-utilized - majoring in Quantitative Economics and Math. I am confident about using Python for pretty much all-things data, except for machine lerning stuff which I am self-teaching and taking online classes. I like footbal (the real one) and reading/watching crime thrillers and satirical shows. Discussing ethical dilemmas is also my niche. And I cannot live without oriental cuisines - my literal and figurative sources of life.

The writings will be mainly produced in Vietnamese and English. Please do share anything with me regarding this web! Thanks for your visit.
