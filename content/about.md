Hi, I'm Hieu!

Years ago, I planned to become an astronaut and play football on the moon. Time passed, plan changed. I am now working on data and policy with a dream of changing something for good.

I am a Master's student in [Computer Science and Public Policy at the University of Chicago](https://capp.uchicago.edu/). Here, I am studying how to build good databases and relevant practices, which will be used for policy analysis and prediction tasks. My current niches are Natural Language Processing applications in evaluating crime and educational interventions. I used to work for an non-profit organization in Vietnam, focusing on database and program evaluation. I like football (the real one), crime thrillers, ethical dilemmas, and satirical shows.
