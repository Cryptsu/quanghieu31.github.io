Years ago, I planned to become an astronaut and play football on the moon. Time passed, plan changed. I am now working on data and policy with a dream of changing something for good.

I develop this web to practice writing concisely and explaining complex things. In the long run, I would like to be better at machine learning applications in a development context and economic modelling.

I am studying Computer Science and Public Policy at the University of Chicago. I used to work for an non-profit organization in Vietnam, focusing on database and program evaluation. I am confident about Python for exploratory data analysis and data cleaning. I like football (the real one), crime thrillers, and satirical shows. Ethical dilemmas are also my niche. I cannot live without oriental cuisines.

The writings are mainly in Vietnamese and English. Please share anything with me regarding this web! Thanks for your visit.
